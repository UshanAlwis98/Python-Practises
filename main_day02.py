# Day 02 Final Task

#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
# total_amount = input("What was the total bill?\n")
# tip_amount = input("How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15?\n")
# num_of_people = input("How many people to split the bill?\n")
#
# each_balance = ((float(total_amount)/100) * (100+float(tip_amount))) / int(num_of_people)
# print(round(each_balance,2))
